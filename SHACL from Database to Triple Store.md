He’s the AI the manages HR.

I had not originally intended to write this article, but during a recent consultation, the question arose: how do you migrate data from a SQL database (here, SQL Server) into a knowledge graph (Jena-Fuseki), using an LLM (in this case, Claude)?

It turns out that this is a *great* use case for SHACL, for a very simple reason:
> SHACL is a schema abstraction layer. It essentially describes shapes, properties, connections and constraints, and only secondarily does it explicitly bind to the RDF data model.

As such it makes a perfect bridge for going from one schematic language to another. In the example covered here, that initial schematic language is the Data Definition Language, or DDL, which is used to construct a relational database, and can be exported by all current SQL databases.

This led to the creation of Shaclify. Shaclify is an open source AI driven project that uses SHACL as its common bridge. It has a [github repo](https://github.com/kurtcagle/shaclify).

Note that shaclify is not (currently) a fully fleshed out application but rather is intended to showcase how you can use SHACL and AI to build semantic mappings. Over time, this will likely change.

In this particular case, I created a test HR database with ten tables, and exported the DDL as text. I also exported all of the tables as CSV files (for a small to mid-sized database, you may also want to export the database as an Excel file, which lets you keep the files together as a package).

Once I had the DDL, I included it as part of the following prompt:

The address <https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/WD-shacl12-core-20260211/> is the most recent SHACL 1.2 Core working draft (see <https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl12-core/> to get the latest core implementation, as it is still evolving).

The key point is that the SHACL files need only be (and should only be) generated once for a given SQL DDL. This becomes the reference schema and should be saved as such. Once this is created, This is then used to generate the corresponding TARQL transformations. [Tarql](https://tarql.github.io/) is one of my favorite tools, and should be part of every ontologist’s repertoire - it converts CSV files into RDF Triples (as Turtle). It is Java-based command line tool, using the same ARQ libraries that are part of the Apache Jena project. The TARQL files are essentially SPARQL with some additional properties for handling record (table/column/row) type input.

Building such TARQL files by hand could be time-consuming, especially for a typical commercial database with dozens or even hundreds of tables. However, by creating the SHACL file, what you have done is provided the structural translation layer for the TARQL to do the relevant mappings for you - including the mapping between tables in the SQL database. Running the TARQL on the corresponding CSV files (as a command-line process typically, as this doesn’t require any AI assistance once the tarql is generated), will then generate the corresponding Turtle. An employee record in our HR scheme looks like the following:

while an employee training record would look as follows:

Note that in this particular case, there are now IRI links for `hr:course` and `hr:employee` . This means that we have successfully replaced the foreign key → primary key reference used in the DDL to IRIs in the Turtle.

Once you have created the triples, you can then post them to a triple store database, such as the Apache Jena open source triple-store. As a general rule of thumb, you can do an initial creation of the knowledge graph based upon a full dump of the CSV files using tarql, then can create CSV diffs that will generate the updates. Because a triple store manages sets of triples rather than documents and because you have consistent generation rules through tarql, links to existing entities in the knowledge graph should be preserved.

A second advantage of have the SHACL file generated - you can use it generate subsequent queries against the knowledge graph from claude or similar GPT:

This creates the following SPARQL:

Note that while this could be used to create a general natural language query system, a better strategy may be to come up with a list of 10-20 frequently asked questions and turn these into a report generator through an API. My general experience is that providing an open-ended query on a knowledge graph is usually a bad idea.

There are a few observations to bring up here.

* The model created in this process is likely to hew closely to the SQL database model. This might not be ideal for a general knowledge graph, in part because it brings along SQL relational modelling assumptions that may not fully leverage RDF semantics.

* To that end, if you have a more expansive existing reference schema, it may be worth repeating the process on DDL to Schema conversion but with the caveat that it must follow the same design patterns as the reference schema. One of the biggest such design patterns is whether or not a schema uses a top-down approach (with one parent having a directed connection to a number of children) or a bottom-up approach (with each child connecting to the parent, which is usually the case with SQL because of the nature of foreign key to primary key mappings).

* The created ontology is structural only. You may want to either select an industry focused upper ontology or generate an upper ontology on the existing schema, or may look to remap the generated ontology to use an existing upper ontology. The following illustrates one such example (generating an upper ontology).

<!-- -->

* Using the above prompt lets you create a first blush upper ontology. The generated triples are shown in the [schemas/hr_upper_ontology.ttl file](https://github.com/kurtcagle/shaclify/blob/main/schema/hr_upper_ontology.ttl) in the github repo. Note, I generally recommend going the other way (build the upper ontology, then extend to the generated schema), but this illustrates how you can support an inheritance layer.

* The key in all cases is to look at SHACL as a reference schema for mapping data from one ontology to another. You can also generate via LLM a SPARQL-Update file that will allow for internal mappings of one schema to another if both are already expressed in Turtle or other forms of RDF, especially when used in conjunction with an indexed triple store.

**Issue** : Position codes in CSV use format “MKT-MGR”, “SR-SWE”, “LEAD-SWE”

* DATA-ANALYST (Data Analyst)

* SR-SWE (Senior Software Engineer)

**Resolution** : This is a schema design issue, not a data issue. The SHACL pattern should be updated to:

turtle

    `sh:pattern "^[A-Z0-9-]{2,20}$"  # Allow hyphens`

Data integration could often take weeks or even months of work. AI can compress that to a matter of hours, but to do so, it needs structural information that lets it bridge between different systems and their intrinsic ontologies. That’s what SHACL has the potential to become - an abstract representation of both the structure and intent of an enterprise data system, useful for knowledge graphs but just as useful as a general tool for interchange.
